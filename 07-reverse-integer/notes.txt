This was interesting insofar as the asymptotic complexity analysis is a bit atypical for most algorithmic problems one might see in toy problems: the solution grows in relation to the input value's length rather than its cardinal value, with the former being logarithmic in relation to the latter. This means that even though the solution above has some code structures one might reasonable associate with a linear runtime complexity, looping over each element in an array, for instance, the actual complexity is similarly logarithmic, provided there are no nested functions etc. This seems to be the best achievable result in a broad sense, though the solution certainly has opportunities for optimizations.
